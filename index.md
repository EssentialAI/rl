# Preface

This book contains my personal notes for the course [AI: Reinforcement Learning in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-reinforcement-learning-in-python/).

Notes are listed `chapter-wise` on the left hand side. Each chapter has contents listed on the right hand side.

This course will be mathematically intensive and requires a comprehensive understanding of Linear and Logistic Regression as pre-requisites. Machine Learning concepts are explained clearly [here](https://essentialai.github.io/ml.html).
