### Preface
This book is written with the aim of consolidating reference material for Reinforcement Learning multiple books and course videos. The topics of this book become progressively complex and mathematically intensive.

### Overview

<span style="color:blue;">*Reinforcement Learning (RL) tries to mimic human behaviour of learning through experience.*</span> RL attempts to copy the process of learning by interacting with environment to learn strategies. RL is exciting because it is possible to learn long-term strategies and apply them to complex industrial problems. While Machine Learning is not intrinsively designed to solve sequential decision making, and RL attempts to solve this exact problem. 

### Objective
There are numerous courses and reference books online. Some courses are oriented towards academia, while others are industry-related. However, <span style="color:blue;">*navigating through the plethora of courses and the respective code may be a hassle.*</span>

*"The first is that I entirely avoid code listings. I believe that in most cases books are not an appropriate place for code listingsâ€”software engineering books are an obvious exception."*

Code from multiple courses is consolidated in a way that makes comprehensive connection between modules. <span style="color:blue;">*This online-book is made to integrate the benefits of both coding environments and reference books.*</span>

I have tried to write the entire code in this book from scratch. While many students are enthralled by the applications of RL, very few resources are available to actually comprehend the intricate internal **mathematics** behind RL. Through this book, I aim to teach Reinforcement Learning from the ground-up so that readers can appreciate it's (RL's) true potential from a *mathematical perspective while extending their learnings to industrial applications.*

Thanks to Jupyter-book for making such a beautiful project that allowed me to write this book.
