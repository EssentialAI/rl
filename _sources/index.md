### Preface

This book is written with the aim of consolidating reference material for Reinforcement Learning from multiple books and course videos. <span class='heading'>The topics of this book become progressively more complex and mathematically intensive.</span>

### Overview

<span class = 'hital'>Reinforcement Learning (RL) tries to mimic human behaviour of 'learning through experience.'</span> RL attempts to copy the process of learning strategies by interacting with environment. RL is exciting because it is possible to learn long-term strategies and apply them to complex industrial problems. This is due to the fact that Machine Learning is not intrinsively designed to solve sequential decision making, and RL attempts to solve this problem by learning to maximize optimal reward through trail and error. 

### Objective
There are numerous courses and reference books online on Reinforcement Learning. Some courses are oriented towards academia, while others are industry-related. However, <span class='hital'>navigating through the plethora of courses and their respective code may be a hassle.</span>

```{admonition} Why this online-book?
:class: tip
[Source](https://rl-book.com/)
<span class='nital'>"The first is that I entirely avoid code listings. I believe that in most cases books are not an appropriate place for code listingsâ€”software engineering books are an obvious exception."</span>

Some RL books (like the one mentioned above) teach the theory behind RL. To extend these concepts to practical applications, code from multiple courses is consolidated in a way that enables comprehensive connection between modules. <span class = 'nital'>*This online-book is made to integrate the benefits of both coding environments and reference books.*</span>
```
I have tried to write the entire code in this book from scratch. While many students are enthralled by the applications of RL, very few resources are available to actually comprehend the intricate **mathematics** behind RL. Through this book, I aim to teach Reinforcement Learning from the ground-up so that readers can appreciate it's (RL's) true potential from a <span class='hital'>mathematical perspective while extending their learnings to industrial applications.</span>
