# Course One

The contents of this sections contain my personal notes for the course [AI: Reinforcement Learning in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-reinforcement-learning-in-python/).

Notes are listed `chapter-wise` on the left hand side.

This course will be mathematically intensive and requires a comprehensive understanding of Linear and Logistic Regression as pre-requisites. Machine Learning concepts are explained clearly [here](https://essentialai.github.io/ml.html).

`Before we dive into this course, let's understand the structure of the entire course`

**Multi-Armed Bandit**

Multi-Armed Bandits can be looked at from many perspectives, in this course, we shall use it to understand epsilon-greedy and other algorithms. Extensions of Multi-Armed Bandits include, Recommender Systems, A/B Testing and so on. A/B Testing is something most businesses do. It is because of these real-world applicaitons, the course is made mathematically intensive. These concepts can be extended further

**Full Reinforcement Learning**

This starts with a model. Model makes some suggestions and interacts with the environment. The model for a Reinforcement Learning system will be `Markov Decision Process` (MDP). To understand these systems we learn about:

* Dynamic Programming
* Monte Carlo
* Temporal difference Learning
