# Key elements of RL
#### Agent
An agent is a software program that learns to make intelligent decisions. For instance, a chess player can be considered an agent since the player learns to make the best moves (decisions) to win the game. Similarly, Mario in a Super Mario Bros video game can be considered an agent since Mario explores the game and learns to make the best moves in the game.
#### Environment
The environment is the world of the agent. The agent interacts within the environments. For example, a `chessboard is called the environment` for the chess player agent.
#### State and action
A state is a position or a moment in the environment that the agent can be in. There can be many `positions in the chess board environment` that we discussed earlier. All these positions on the chess board are cosidered to be the state. The movement of the chess player agent (forward, backwward, right, and left) are known as actions. (A state is denoted by $s$, and an action is denoted by $a$).
#### Reward
As we discussed earlier, the agent interacts with the environments by performing actions. Every action has a reward associated to it. This reward is a numerical value, _(+1 or -1 for example)_ that denotes if the agent performed an optimal action or not.

The goal of the RL agent is to `maximize this reward` by performing an optimal set of actions.

This book is structured in the form of courses, that explain Reinforcement Learning from various perspectives. Courses deal with **OpenAIGym environments, creating your own Environment, along with the mathematical explanation for the algorithms** used in RL. Dive in!
