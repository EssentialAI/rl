# [0.2] Probability Warmup
The language of this course is going to be probability. Everything we discuss in this course will be based on undergraduate level probability.

#### Probability Review
Probability is the study of uncertainty. The mathematical theory of probability is very sophisticated, and delves into a branch of analysis known as measure theory. In these notes, we provide a basic treatment of probability that does not address these finer details.

#### [0.2.1] Elements of Probability

Listed below are the basic elements of probability.

<span class = 'blue'>Sample Space ($\Omega$)</span>: The set of all the outcomes of a random experiment. Here, each outcome $\omega \in \Omega$ can be thought of as a complete description of the state of the real world at the end of the experiment.

<span class = 'blue'>Set of Events ($\mathcal{F}$)</span>: A set whose elements $A \in \mathcal{F}$ (called *events*)
