### What is Reinforcement Learning?
Do you remember the first time you learned to ride a bike? Learning to ride a bike is a trial and error process. We lose control, fall down, yet we ultimately learn to balance the bike.

**What if we could make a machine learn the way humans do?** (i.e., learn through experience)

This question has led to a field that is now called **Reinforcement Learning.** RL is a sub-set of `Machine Learning` in which the model (as called as **Agent**) learns by interacting with the **environment** just like humans. Unlike `Supervised` and `Unsupervised` Machine Learning, RL agents can truly understand the consequence (called **reward**) at every step (**action**) inside the environment.

Techniques from both supervised learning and unsupervised learning can be used within RL to aid `generalization`. In RL, we focus on the problem of learning while interacting with an ever-changing world. <span style="color:blue"> *We expect our agents to get things wrong, to refine their understanding as they go.* </span> An agent that immediately integrates its most recent experience should do well especially compared with ones that attempt to memorize how the world works. RL aims to bridging the gaps in `Artificial General Intelligence`.

Just a few years ago, `AlphaGO` has beaten the world champion at the game `GO`. These agents can train and compete with each other to attain super-human level intelligence. RL models can now play various atari games and learn to adapt to changes in the environments. Reinforcement Learning does not stop there, RL models can be extended to real-world applications such as teaching a robot how to walk just by simulations. An AI can build on previous discoveries much more faster than a human can. AI seems to follow the law of [accelerating returns.](https://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns)

Okay, that's very exciting, but how does one get started with Reinforcement Learning?
