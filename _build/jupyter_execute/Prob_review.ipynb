    "# [0.2] Probability Review\n",
    "The language of this course is going to be probability. Everything we discuss in this course will be based on undergraduate level probability. Probability is the study of uncertainty. The mathematical theory of probability is very sophisticated, and delves into a branch of analysis known as measure theory. In these notes, we provide a basic treatment of probability that does not address these finer details.\n",

    "The set of all the outcomes of a random experiment. Here, each outcome $\\omega \\in S$ can be thought of as a complete description of the state of the real world at the end of the experiment.\n",

    "The sample space $S$ is the set of all possible oucomes of a random experiment.\n",

    "Depending on the random experiment, $S$ may be finite, countably infinite and uncountably infinite. For a random coin toss, $S =\\{H,T\\}$ so $|S|=2$.\n",

    "(1) Roll a die: the outcome is the number on the upturned face, so $S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, |S| = 6.$\n",

    "(2) Toss a coin until Heads appears: the outcome is the number of tosses required, so $S = {1, 2, 3, . . . }, |S| = ∞.$\n",

    "A set whose elements, $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ (called events) are subsets of $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An event is a collection of possible outcomes of a random experiment. Usually write $A, B, . . .$ to denote events. So an event $A$ is a subset of $S$, the sample space, that is $A ⊂ S$. Usually an event contains the set of outcomes which make the answer to a question ‘Yes’. Saying ‘the outcome is in $A$’ is the same as saying ‘the event A is true’. There are two special events: the whole sample space S is called the certain or the sure event. The empty set ∅ is the null event.\n",

    "Two events are called independent if and only if $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)$ (or equivalently, $P(A|B)=P(A)$). Therefore, independence is equivalent to saying that observing $B$ does not have any effect on the probability of $A$.\n",

    "Out of these approximately, $1/13$ will have $B$ also true. So we expect $P(A \\cap B) = (1/2)(1/13) = P(A) \\cdot P(B|A)$. This line of reasoning leads to the result shown in the above equation.\n",
